# Flashcards
# Context and goal

I have done this application as a learning project and wanted to try to do a mobile app to help me study for an upcoming test. I was very excited to finally be able to combine coding and aviation. 

This app is made to be simple. 
It's made with React Native, coupled with some extra nice packages to handle routing.

## Main technologies used

- [React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native)

## Running the project

- Clone this project
```
git clone < project-url.git >
```

- [Install NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) on your computer.

- [Install yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) on your computer
> Yarn is a dependency manager built by facebook and google. It is a more efficient and reliable (thanks to yarn.lock) alternative of npm.

- Launch ``` yarn ``` command in a terminal opened in the project folder.
> This command will look into the *package.json* file and install all the dependencies listed here.

- Install react-native-cli globally on your computer
